---

Open the site, roll up a mouse, and go. To play together, the GM opens a room and
shares a link — the connection runs directly between browsers (WebRTC), with no
data passing through the operator's server.

## For players

- **Character sheet** — STR / DEX / WIL (current & max), Hit Protection, Pips, XP,
  Grit, a portrait and notes. Everything autosaves in the browser.
- **Character creation to SRD 2.3.1** — 3d6 (keep the two highest), HP & Pips at 1d6
  each, the full 36-entry background table with starting gear, the weak-mouse rule,
  birthsign · coat · detail.
- **Drag-and-drop inventory** — two paws, two body, six pack; 1- and 2-slot items,
  swapping, usage dice, conditions as cards. Every item has an icon you can change.
- **Dice** — d6, d66 and saves (d20 ≤ attribute) with advantage / disadvantage.
  Clicking a weapon's damage value rolls it (one-paw and two-paw separately). Every
  roll shows up in the dice panel.
- **Rest helper** — short / long / full, with ration use and attribute healing by
  the book.

## For GMs

- **Dashboard** — every hero at a glance: portrait, HP, scores, armour, filled
  slots, weapons, conditions.
- **Per-mouse actions** — damage, heal, pips, XP, trigger a rest, call for a save
  or initiative, whisper, announce to all, give an item or a condition.
- **Dice panel** with a result stage, reaction and treasure rolls, and a roll log
  that also shows the players' rolls.
- **Shared table** — a common loot drop; items can be prepared and hidden from the
  players until they're "on the table".
- **Time & light** — turn / watch / day counter, torch and encounter countdowns,
  an alarm banner on an encounter or omen, an optional time-of-day readout for the
  players.
- **NPC & combat tracker** — creatures from the SRD or your own, attack and morale
  rolls in one click, individual NPCs toggled visible to the players.
- **Save & load a session**, plus general notes.

## Playing together

- **Serverless multiplayer** over WebRTC / PeerJS. The GM is the host; players join
  with a 4-character code or a `?join` link. Reconnect and reload recovery are
  built in.
- **Shared round log** — the GM opens it up, then every player sees the round's
  rolls and events on their own sheet. Players' rolls always reach the GM regardless.
- **Optional Discord webhook** — mirrors rolls and events into a channel. The URL
  lives in `localStorage` only, never in the character file.

## Also

Collapsible panels (state remembered) · light / dark toggle with its own
background image per mode · a dice panel that sticks in view on wide screens ·
JSON export / import of the sheet · runs offline from a single file.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # -> dist/index.html  (one portable file, viteSingleFile)
npm run preview
npm run lint       # oxlint
```

A push to `main` builds and deploys via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

**Stack:** Vite + React 19 (plain JS, no TypeScript), `@dnd-kit` for the inventory
grid, `peerjs` for multiplayer, `lucide-react` for icons. No backend, no account.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome — translations especially. The UI ships in English,
German, Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese. Spanish was contributed by
[@Salgraphics](https://github.com/Salgraphics); FR/IT/JA are machine-assisted, so
corrections from native speakers are very welcome. The flow and the steps for a
new language are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
